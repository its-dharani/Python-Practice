# Python-Practice

This repository is a personal learning space where I upload **small Python programs** to recall, revise, and strengthen my understanding of **core Python concepts**.

Each file represents a concept I’ve practiced intentionally — focusing on clarity, logic, and consistency rather than complexity.

## Daily Practice

### Day 1 – Number Guessing Game
- Used `random` to generate a number  
- Took user input and compared values  
- Practiced basic `if/else` conditions  

---

### Day 2 – Password Strength Checker
- Checked password length  
- Looked for at least one uppercase letter and one number  
- Used a loop and simple boolean variables  

---

### Day 3 – Simple Calculator
- Took two numbers and an operator as input  
- Used basic arithmetic operations  
- Used `if/elif` to choose the operation  

---

### Day 4 – String Combinations Program
- Sorted characters of a string  
- Generated combinations of different lengths  
- Used the `itertools` module  

---

### Day 5 – Runner-Up Score Finder
- Read input scores and stored them in a list  
- Removed duplicate values using a set  
- Sorted the unique scores to find the ranking  
- Printed the second highest score as the runner-up  


## 🎯 Purpose of this Repository
